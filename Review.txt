The Makefile is usually up ubove the whole code structure. Something like:

README.md
Makefile
- include
- src
...

README.md file could have been written a bit better.
  Divide the section better
  Highlight code blocks
  
  Usually a README.md has the following structure:
    - configuration (ie, which variables in the Makefile to change)
    - build (ie, compilation)
    - execution (show how to run a test)

Markdown should be helpfull in writing fancy READMEs


Code comments:
Personally, I don't like the usage of breaks
Recall that the std::pow method is very slow for integer powers. Overload the opearator or write directly the function
Why the maximum number of iterations m_n_max_it been divided by 10 in the for loop for solveArmijo?
